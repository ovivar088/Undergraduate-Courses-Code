a) The output at Line 15 is "205"

b)This is because the command/assignment x=0, within the bop function,
  is strictly within the scope of the bop function. That assignment 
  value is not replaced within the scope of the main function. We are
  only passing in a copy of x.

c) 3 1 6 
d) When calling the function biff the biff function incrememnts 1 to 
   every element wihtin the array. However, the functions looks for 
   the address of the array and changes the terms in the address, 
   therefore permanently changing the value of array a[].

e) 20 10

f) The initial array is passed to the ugh function, however within
   the function a "new" array is delcared and the new array arr is 
   filled with 0's while the initial array is unaffected. The keyword
   new allows for a essentially a copy of arr be made so that []b is 
   unaffected.
